**Pathfinding Algorithms - Flow Field Pathfinding**

![Video Demonstration](https://www.google.co.nz/)

* Background - what was the approach previously
    * AStar or dijstras algorithms. very good for single entity, however each additional entity increases the computational requrement significantly.
* Details of the approach
    
    *Details...Steps:
    1.  collect world data
    2.  dijstras algorithm
    3.  vector calculations
    4.  movement
* Optional variations
    * leader follower system
